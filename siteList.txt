300 North LaSalle
300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, IL

I saw 300 North LaSalle walking eastward down the Chicago River's south bank.
Built in 2009 under Oklahoma City architect Pickard Chilton
(https://www.archdaily.com/146450/300-north-lasalle-pickard-chilton), it
attained a LEED Platinum certification: with more emphasis on sustainability,
today's evaluation of a modernist skyscraper must consider both form and
function. Here we see a nod toward conservationism and the postmodern. If such
a magnific structure as 300 North LaSalle should seem blasé or overshadowed in a
city filled with structural landmarks, this points to the vehicularisation of
Chicago's modernist æsthetic.

Erie County Courthouse
323 Columbus Avenue, Sandusky, OH

Erie County‘s courthouse in Sandusky was built in 1872 by Cleveland architects
Myer and Holmes in a richly ornamented Second Empire style complete with mansard
roof.  Most of the façade was remodeled beginning in 1936 in Art Deco in a WPA
project under local architect Henry Millott. Some of the original façade remains
visible around the bottom row of windows. The northeast cornerstone contains two
dates, 1872 and 1938, reflecting the naissance and renaissance of the structure.
