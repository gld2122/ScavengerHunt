Modernism
300 North LaSalle
300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, IL

I saw 300 North LaSalle walking eastward down the Chicago River's south bank.
Built in 2009 under Oklahoma City architect Pickard Chilton
(https://www.archdaily.com/146450/300-north-lasalle-pickard-chilton), it
attained a LEED Platinum certification: with more emphasis on sustainability,
today's evaluation of a modernist skyscraper must consider both form and
function. Here we see a nod toward conservationism and the postmodern. If such
a magnific structure as 300 North LaSalle should seem blasé or overshadowed in a
city filled with structural landmarks, this points to the vehicularisation of
Chicago's modernist æsthetic.

New Deal
Erie County Courthouse
323 Columbus Avenue, Sandusky, OH

Erie County‘s courthouse in Sandusky was built in 1872 by Cleveland architects
Myer and Holmes in a richly ornamented Second Empire style complete with mansard
roof. Most of the façade was remodeled beginning in 1936 in Art Deco in a WPA
project under local architect Henry Millott. Some of the original façade remains
visible around the bottom row of windows. The northeast cornerstone contains two
dates, 1872 and 1938, reflecting the naissance and re-naissance of the structure.

Consumerism
Tiffany Mosaic
111 North State Street, Chicago, IL

Marshall Field and Company flagship department store on State Street was the epicentre of Chicago's consumer dreamscape. The building's central atrium is crowned by a luxurious Tiffany mosaic in blue, green, and gold iridescent glass. According to Leach, "the dome's shape consisting of three concentric circles contributed to the illusion of open-ended space or of a heavenly domain without limits" (77).

Working-class housing
1880 stone house
810 Market Street, Sandusky, OH

This two-story stone house was built in 1880 across Market Street from the RB
Hubbard & Son Lumber Yard and catty-corner to the Sandusky Electric Light, Gas,
Fuel and Supply Company. The lumberyard block was surrounded by storefronts,
mainly drug stores, according to the 1886 Sanborn map for Sandusky. Other
industries were located in the neighborhood as well, as it lied along the
terminus of the Indiana, Bloomington, and Western Railway. Thus the early
industrial pattern of living near the workplace is visible.

Factory
Medusa Portland Cement Company
Barrett Road, Sandusky, OH

Founded in 1892 by three sons of geologist John Strong Newberry, Medusa Cement
did a profitable business supplying cement for the building boom in the first
half of twentieth century. The factory anchored the tiny unincorporated
community of Bay Bridge, just west of the also tiny village of Bay View.

Adaptive Re-use
Chesapeake Lofts
401 West Shoreline Drive, Sandusky, OH

The former Hinde & Dauch Paper Company was renovated into apartment units in
2007. This factory was the birthplace of the corrugated box, and Hinde & Dauch
became the largest producer of the item worldwide. Both men were natives of the
Sandusky area who started out as farmers; they entered the paper business
together by partnering to sell bails of straw to paper mills. When they entered
the mill business themselves, their efforts were unprofitable until they hit on
the innovation of corrugation. After moving between a few locations, their main
factory at the foot of Jackson Street was completed in 1918.
