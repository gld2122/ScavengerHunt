Modernism
300 North LaSalle
300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, IL

I saw 300 North LaSalle walking eastward down the Chicago River's south bank.
Built in 2009 under Oklahoma City architect Pickard Chilton
(https://www.archdaily.com/146450/300-north-lasalle-pickard-chilton), it
attained a LEED Platinum certification: with more emphasis on sustainability,
today's evaluation of a modernist skyscraper must consider both form and
function. Here we see a nod toward conservationism and the postmodern. If such
a magnific structure as 300 North LaSalle should seem blasé or overshadowed in a
city filled with structural landmarks, this points to the vehicularisation of
Chicago's modernist æsthetic.

New Deal
Erie County Courthouse
323 Columbus Avenue, Sandusky, OH

Erie County‘s courthouse in Sandusky was built in 1872 by Cleveland architects
Myer and Holmes in a richly ornamented Second Empire style complete with mansard
roof.  Most of the façade was remodeled beginning in 1936 in Art Deco in a WPA
project under local architect Henry Millott. Some of the original façade remains
visible around the bottom row of windows. The northeast cornerstone contains two
dates, 1872 and 1938, reflecting the naissance and renaissance of the structure.

Working-class housing
1880 stone house
810 Market Street, Sandusky, OH

This two-story stone house was built in 1880 across Market Street from the RB
Hubbard & Son Lumber Yard and catty-corner to the Sandusky Electric Light, Gas,
Fuel and Supply Company. The lumberyard block was surrounded by storefronts,
mainly serving as drug stores, according to the 1886 Sanborn map for Sandusky.
Other industries were located in the neighborhood as well, as it lied along the
terminus of the Indiana, Bloomington, and Western Railway.

Founded in 1892 by three sons of geologist John Strong Newberry, Medusa Cement
